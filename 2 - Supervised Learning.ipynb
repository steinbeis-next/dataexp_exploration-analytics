    "## 1. Case description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Problem\n",
    "In financial institutions, the process of loan approval and determining the interest rate offered is critical in mitigating potential risks and maximizing returns. The decision-making process involves assessing the risk of each loan application based on various factors, such as credit score, income, and past repayment history. The assessment informs the bank of the probability of the borrower defaulting on the loan, which affects the interest rate offered to the applicant. Therefore, having a reliable and accurate risk assessment model is essential for financial institutions to make informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Problem\n",
    "The research problem is to develop a classification model that can accurately classify loan applications into risk or no-risk categories. The model will review historical data on past loan applications and outcomes to identify patterns and predict the probability of the loan defaulting. Based on the model output, the loan applications shall be classified into those with low or high risk. The outcome of the model will help the bank make informed decisions on the loan amount, interest rates, and payment schedules, thus mitigating potential risks and enhancing returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Data\n",
    "The training dataset will consist of past loan applications and the corresponding outcomes. The data points collected will include the borrower's credit score, income, years of experience, and financial history such as investments, credit card debt, mortgage information, and other assets. The outcome variable will be a binary classification of either a loan default or no default. The model will undergo a series of tests using cross-validation techniques before implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "Developing a risk assessment model for loan applications is crucial for financial institutions to minimize risks and maximize profitability. Students in a university can engage in this problem to gain hands-on experience with data analysis and predictive modeling. The project will involve building and benchmarking classification models that can accurately classify loan applications, considering various features to predict if a loan is likely to default or not. The project will allow students to learn the methods of data pre-processing, model building and evaluation."

    "When analyzing a Confusion Matrix, there are two facets of errors that we are particularly interested in. These can be framed as two questions: \n",
    "- how many of the accused (risky credits) were correctly identified, and\n",
    "- how many of the risky loans were detected?\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions are answered by the metrics Precision and Recall (read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall)).\n",

As such, Recall, with its emphasis on identifying risks, should be valued more highly than Precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand Precision and Recall as they represent two key metrics for evaluating predictive models. Precision measures the ability of the model to avoid making false positive predictions, while Recall measures the ability to detect all positive instances. In other words, Precision identifies how many of the predicted risks were actual risks, and Recall indicates how many of the actual risks were predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, it is crucial for businesses to use models that optimize both Precision and Recall. An overly strict model may have high Precision but low Recall, resulting in missed opportunities for growth. On the other hand, an overly lenient model may have high Recall but low Precision, leading to a greater number of false positives and missed opportunities. Finding the right balance between these two metrics is key to building a successful predictive model and avoiding costly errors down the line."
