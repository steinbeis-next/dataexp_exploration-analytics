    "The CRM team of a telecommunications company is developing a customer retention campaign for private customers. To make them stay loyal to the company, free months and discounts will be offered for signing up for a contract extension.\n",

    "For the campaign to be successful economically, it is necessary to only target customers with a high risk of cancelling. Otherwise, the campaign would be giving out unnecessary discounts, resulting in immediate lost revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset description\n",
    "The data set includes the following features, some features for the months september (sep_...) and october (oct_...):\n",
    "- Aggregate of Total Revenue: The overall monthly revenue earned in Rupees by the carrier in the months August & September.\n",
    "- Aggregate of SMS Revenue: The revenue earned through the SMS service used by the subscriber.\n",
    "- Aggregate of Data Revenue: The revenue earned through the Data service used by the subscriber.\n",
    "- Aggregate of Off Net Revenue: The revenue earned by the calls etc. made to the off-network (not the same network as the subscriber) customers by the carrier’s -present subscriber.\n",
    "- Aggregate of On Net Revenue: The revenue earned by the calls etc. made to the on-network (on the same network as the subscriber) customers by the carrier’s present subscriber.-\n",
    "- Network Age: The time passed since the subscriber started using the services of the carrier.\n",
    "- User Type: This detail helps in knowing if the user is subscribed to a 2G (voice, no data plan) or 3G/4G/5G... (\"3G\") service.\n",
    "- Aggregate of Complaint Count: The number of complaints made by the subscribers.\n",
    "- Favorite Other Network: This information can certainly have a huge impact on churn ratio as it gives the information about which other network or operator the subscribers makes the most of the calls to and thus might influence the customer to move to that network to save money.\n",
    "- Aggregate of Data Volume: The volume of the data service used by the subscriber.\n",
    "- Class: Did the customer churn or remain active."
